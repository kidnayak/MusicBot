# MusicBot
A Bot which takes an input, rips the MP4 off YouTube and plays it on a separate application. 
Basically you input the name of the song/video in the search box, the bot takes the first result from youtube and plays it in the application itself. 
No need to fuss over youtube tracking your data.
(The app is still very rough around the edges, especially the GUI.)
